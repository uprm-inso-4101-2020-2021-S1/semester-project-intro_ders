## Welcome to Introders Project

# INTRODUCTION

The Registraduria office at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayagüez is in charge of ensuring and guaranteeing the 3 points mentioned below to active and inactive students of the university:
 
*Maintain and keep confidential academic records in accordance with applicable regulations.
*Easy access to the services offered.
*Efficient enrollment and graduation processes.
 
Due to the recent situation with the COVID-19, these mentioned points have been affected. The reason is that 14 of the 16 requests offered by this office cannot be completed electronically. Currently, the process to submit a request is through PDF documents located on the Registraduría’s web page and sent using email, Fax, or PO box. The method used to send the request does not guarantee that the request will be received, and the student cannot verify the status of the request. Considering that these requirements are very important for academic progress and performance, this undoubtedly will affect the college community.
